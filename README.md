Confloose
=========

A *confloose* (or "loose configuration") is a collection of the worst a startup
script can do for you.

When someone leaves his computer without locking it, the tradition here is to
install such scripts on his computer while he's away -- as such, a confloose is
a challenge (it makes you learn your unix environment the hard way), and a way
to remind you to never leave your computer and/or data in public space without
protection.

Rules :
-------
1. Don't destroy user data.
2. Don't steal user data.
3. Be fun and creative.
